To build the BrainSlug channel you must first have a copy of devkitPPC:
    https://devkitpro.org
You must also have libmxml for devkitPPC, which can be installed via pacman:
You also need to have libfat installed.

In the root directory of the BrainSlug repository, run the commands:
    make

The channel will be generated as `boot.elf' and `boot.dol' in the `bin'
subdirectory. Temporary working files will be places in the `build'
subdirectory. `boot.map', a symbol map, will also be generated.

To make a release you can run
    make release

This will construct the folder structure that should be put on the SD card
suitable for distribution to end users. You can specify `RELEASE=dir' to release
to a specific directory (default release).

To improve the build time, the `-j' flag can be added to the `make' command to
parallelise the build.

The optional `DEBUG=1' flag can be added on the end of the `make' command in
order to enable debugging assertions in the code.

An assembly code listing can be generated with:
    make list

To delete generated files run:
    make clean
