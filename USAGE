BrainSlug Wii
    by Chadderz

BrainSlug is a specialised Wii disc loader which is designed to allow the loaded
game to be patched. BrainSlug is designed to make the process of adding
functionality to Wii games much easier and more enjoyable for all.

The BrainSlug channel is still very simple, it lacks any sort of user interface
or even configuration file. When it starts, BrainSlug immediately begins loading
the disc in the drive. It then searches sd:/bslug/modules for .mod BrainSlug
module files. It also searches sd:/bslug/symbols for .xml symbol information.
Using all of this information it patches the game and boots it. If any error
messages or warnings occur, you will need to press the RESET button on the Wii
before it can be launched or the channel exits.

When searching for either modules or symbols, the channel will search any
subdirectories for which the game ID is a prefix. For example the game ID of
Mario Kart Wii PAL is RMCP. Therefore if a folder called RMC exists in modules
or symbols it will be searched. The game ID of Zelda: Twilight Princess PAL is
RZDP so this would not look in the RMC directory. This allows game specific
configurations.
