To install BrainSlug for development of modules you must first have a copy of
devkitPro, specifically with devkitPPC included:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/devkitpro/

In the root directory of the BrainSlug repository, run the following commands:
    make clean && make -C modules clean
    make install
    
It may be necessary to run the last command with administrative privileges.

This installs the necessary headers into a bslug subdirectory within devkitPro.
Now BrainSlug modules can be compiled. See modules/README for more information
about BrainSlug module development.

To uninstall run:
    make uninstall
