To install BrainSlug for development of modules you must first have a copy of
devkitPPC installed. You can obtain this from devkitPro (https://devkitpro.org)

In the root directory of the BrainSlug repository, run the following commands:
    make clean && make -C modules clean
    make install

This installs the necessary headers into a bslug subdirectory. Please do not
install this to /opt/devkitpro which is reserved for devkitPro tools and libraries.

Now BrainSlug modules can be compiled. See modules/README for more information
about BrainSlug module development.

To uninstall run:
    make uninstall
